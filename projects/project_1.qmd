## Introduction

The **Amazon Purchase Predictor Regression Model** aims to analyze purchasing behaviors based on demographic and transaction data. The primary goal was to predict **log_total**, the total spending amount in log scale, using various explanatory variables. By implementing regression techniques, this study identifies key factors influencing customer spending habits and provides insights into consumer behavior.

## Process

To build the predictive model, the following steps were taken:

1.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    -   Cleaned and handled missing values.\
    -   Normalized and transformed variables where necessary.\
    -   Selected relevant features based on correlation and importance.
2.  **Model Selection & Training:**
    -   Experimented with multiple regression models, including **Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, and KNN Regression**.\
    -   Tuned hyperparameters using cross-validation for optimal performance.
3.  **Feature Engineering:**
    -   Identified key explanatory variables such as **count_hh4** (household size) and **count_G** (order count), which showed a strong correlation with **log_total**.\
    -   Considered interactions between income level and purchasing frequency to refine the model.

## Outcome

The final model selected was a **Random Forest regression model**, which achieved:

-   **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** **0.1128934**\

-   **Standard Error (SE):** **0.003002182**\

-   **RÂ² Score:** *Higher than 0.9587, indicating strong predictive power.*

-   The results confirmed that **household size, order count, and income level were significant predictors** of Amazon purchases.\

-   **KNN regression was tested but did not outperform tree-based models in terms of accuracy.**
