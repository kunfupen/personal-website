## Introduction

The **To-Do List Application** is a simple Java-based program that allows users to manage tasks with basic **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality**. It uses **PostgreSQL** as the backend database for task storage and provides an interactive user interface for managing tasks efficiently.

## Process  

To develop the **To-Do List Application**, the following steps were taken:  

1. **Database Setup:**  
   - Designed a **PostgreSQL database schema** with a tasks table.  
   - Defined columns for **task ID, name, description, due date, and status**.  

2. **JDBC Integration:**  
   - Established a **JDBC connection** to interact with the PostgreSQL database.  
   - Implemented **SQL queries** for inserting, retrieving, updating, and deleting tasks.  

3. **Backend Development:**  
   - Created a **Java application** with CRUD operations.  
   - Used **Prepared Statements** to prevent SQL injection.  

4. **User Interface Implementation:**  
   - Developed a **console-based UI** for task management.  
   - Provided user-friendly prompts for adding, viewing, updating, and deleting tasks.  

5. **Testing & Debugging:**  
   - Tested database interactions with sample task entries.  
   - Debugged connection issues and ensured data integrity.  

## Features  

1. **Add Task:**  
   - Create a new task with a **name, description, due date, and status**.  

2. **View Tasks:**  
   - Retrieve and display all tasks stored in the database.  

3. **Update Task:**  
   - Modify the task **name and status**.  

4. **Delete Task:**  
   - Remove a task from the database permanently.
   
   
## Outcome  

The project successfully implements a **task management system** with fundamental database operations. Future enhancements may include:  

- **User authentication** for personalized task management  
- **Task filtering and sorting** by due date or priority  
- **Integration with a front-end interface** for a better user experience
